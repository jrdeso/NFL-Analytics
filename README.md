# NFL-Analytics

# Description:
This project aims to analyze and predict NFL player and team performance using machine learning. It involves data scraping, wrangling, cleaning, and building predictive models.

# Status (As of 9/4/2024):
1. Scripts established for scraping NFL player/team data.
2. Completed script for web-scraping weather data to investigate weather's impact on NFL games.
3. Scripts completed to clean/wranlge imported data ensuring consistency and accuracy.

# Future:
- Investigate machine learning models with imported data to predict player and team performance based on past factors (i.e., past games, weather, etc.). Incorporate variety of algorithms (e.g., regression, classification) to find best approach).
